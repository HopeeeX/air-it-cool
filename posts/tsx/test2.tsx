				Regular HVAC maintenance is crucial for keeping your system
				running efficiently and avoiding unexpected breakdowns. But how
				often should you schedule service? The general rule is at least
				twice a yearâ€”once in the spring for your air conditioning and
				once in the fall for your heating system.

				Why Biannual HVAC Service Is Important
			</h2>
			<p className="text-[16px] text-black/75 font-normal text-start pt-3">
				Your HVAC system works year-round to keep your home comfortable.
				Over time, dust, dirt, and wear can affect its performance.
				Routine maintenance ensures:
				<br />
				<br />
				âœ… Better Efficiency â€“ A clean and well-maintained system runs
				smoothly, reducing energy consumption and lowering utility
				bills.
				<br />
				<br />
				âœ… Fewer Breakdowns â€“ Catching minor issues early prevents
				costly repairs or complete system failures.
				<br />
				<br />
				âœ… Longer Lifespan â€“ Regular servicing extends the life of your
				HVAC system, delaying expensive replacements.
				<br />
				<br />âœ… Improved Air Quality â€“ Clean filters and ducts reduce
				allergens, dust, and pollutants in your home.

				What Happens During HVAC Maintenance?
			</h2>
			<p className="text-[16px] text-black/75 font-normal text-start pt-3">
				When you schedule a professional tune-up, an HVAC technician
				will:
				<br />
				ðŸ”¹ Inspect and clean components â€“ Coils, fans, and filters are
				checked and cleaned for optimal airflow.
				<br />
				ðŸ”¹ Test system performance â€“ Ensuring proper cooling and heating
				functions.
				<br />
				ðŸ”¹ Check for refrigerant leaks â€“ Low refrigerant levels can
				cause inefficient cooling.
				<br />
				ðŸ”¹ Lubricate moving parts â€“ Reduces wear and tear on key
				components.
				<br />
				ðŸ”¹ Inspect thermostat settings â€“ Ensuring accurate temperature
				control.
